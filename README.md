#About
As a regular reader of [Paul Graham's](http://paulgraham.com) essays, I wanted to collect them all so that I could read it offline. This is a project written to scrape all of Paul Graham's essays from his website: http://paulgraham.com/articles.html

As of writing this (3 March 2014), there were a total of 155 posts that were collected.

#External Libraries used:
